            <p style="text-align: justify;">
                Football is the most popular sport in the world. According to FIFA, it is followed by over 5 billion fans on all continents.
                Moreover, Deloitte estimates the football market in 2024 at over 35 billion Euros in Europe alone. Through this economic weight and social
                reach, the occurrence of football events may have important economic and social effects.
                The objective of this project is to explore potential correlations between football events and economic and social metrics.

            <p style="text-align: justify;">
               Looking at FIFA's revenues over time, we can gauge the increasing economic importance of football. 
               Those revenues peak
                every 4 years when the male FIFA World Cup is hosted.

            <h3>World Cup Win Effect on Real GDP Growth</h3> 
            <p style="text-align: justify;">
                A research by Mello
                determined that winning a World Cup increases GDP growth by at least 0.25%
                <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/obes.12627">(Mello, 2022)</a>. We 
                investigate this relationship between a victory and GDP growth. 
                Growth rates increase in the year of the victory (t0), although
                we cannot define a causation link.

               Football matches are often associated with disruptions of public order. Indeed, we see that the number of police stops&searches tends to increase on match days.

    <h3>Data Sources & Automation</h3>
    <p style="text-align: justify;"> The data used in this project comes from a variety of sources. Chart 1 (cloropleth map) used a Wikipedia source directly scraped from
        the website, along with data from an Ipsos polling and a geographical coordinates repository. For Chart 2 I used data from FIFA's income statements. 
        Part of those statements could be scraped directly from the FIFA website, while others only existed in PDF form. Some PDFs 
        didn't require authorisation for scraping, so I used Tabula on Python for extraction. Chart 3 data was scraped through the
        IMF API, using the dataset for real GDP growth rates. Each series was batch downloaded using a loop function automatically 
        converting the series into pandas dataframes. For Chart 4 I used the site Investing.com UK, which did not let me scrape directly (403 error).
        I had to download the Excel datasets manually. Chart 5 also used financial data, but to automatise the process I used
        the Yahoo Finance python module. For Chart 6, no precise data was available on the World Cup so I studied Premier League games instead. I used the Police UK API and wrote another loop function, inputing
        geographical coordinates. The loop also converted each series into a dataframe.
    </p>
    <h3>Challenges in Data Cleaning and Analysis</h3>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">
        In chart 2, I encountered data cleaning challenges with the data extracted from the PDF documents, as different columns were often merged together,
        column names were inconsistent and revenues were expressed in different currencies.
        I also had issues when constructing staggered event studies (charts 3 & 4). As t0 corresponded to different
        dates in time, I had to manually calibrate it for each series (ex: in chart 3, France won the WC in 2018 so 
        t0=2018, while for Spain t0=2010). Attributing a relative position to each date (t-3, t+5, etc.) required
        a special function on Python.
        For chart 4, I extracted data for t0 +/- 150 days, but had to restrict it to 30 days to make the chart more readable.
        For chart 6, I had to manually define the areas of interest by fetching the geo coordinates of Premier League stadiums. 
        Building the loop with the integrated df conversion was also tricky as I wanted a separate df for each data series.</p>
    <h3>4- Conclusion</h3>

    <p style="text-align: justify;">
        This research provides some elements to estimate the economic and social aspects of football events. The seasonal nature
        of the revenues perceived by the FIFA, as well as the increase in GDP growth experienced by winning nations on the year of
        the competition support Mello's findings of an economic boost generated by a World Cup win. However, those economic benefits do not
        seem to extend to the stock markets, which seems to be relatively unaffected by football competitions, even when firms
        are directly involved with them. Finally, the occurrence of football games tends to be associated with increased police 
        activity, at least in key English cities. While we cannot extrapolate these findings to other countries or competitions,
        they support the popular view that football games can be a source of disruption of the public order.
        <br><br>
        Further research could put these results into perspective by comparing them with economic and social consequences of
        other popular sport events, such as the Olympic games or the cricket or rugby World Cups. Other types of social
        consequences could also be explored, such as the impact on domestic violence or alcohol consumption.
