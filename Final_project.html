    <h1> Final Project: What Are the Economic and Social Effects of Football Events?</1>

    <h3>1- Introduction</h3>

    <section>
        <div class="chart-description">
            <p style="text-align: justify;">
                Football is the most popular sport in the world. It is followed by over 5 billion fans on all continents. Over time, This
                popularity gave the sport an important financial size. According to Deloitte, the football market in 2024 was estimated at over 35 billion Euros in Europe alone. With such an economic weight and social
                reach, we are prone to ask ourselves what are the economic and social effects generated by the occurrence of football events.
                This project is meant to visually represent some of these effects, drawing from a variety of sources and using charts and maps.
                The objective is not to claim a causation link between football events and economic and social metrics, but rather to highlight
                the existence of certain relationships.
                <br>
                This map is meant to visually represent the global outreach of football. As the name suggests, the FIFA World Cup (WC) hosts football
                nations from all over the world. This massively mediatized event contributed over time to creating large communities of fans in many
                countries represented there.
                <br>
                The information on WC qualification was scraped directly from a Wikipedia page, and the data on the share of the local population
                identifying as football fans is from an Ipsos polling (as the site was protected, I got the info through Excel). I obtained a 
                repository with longitude and latitude data for the centerpoint of each country, to properly position the red circles.

    <h3>2- Economic and Financial Implications</h3>
    <section>
        <div class="chart-description">
            <p style="text-align: justify;">
                The popularity of this sport has made it very economically active. The largest European football clubs now frequently report over 250
                million Euros in annual revenue, mostly generated through ticket sales, commercial merchandise and broadcasting revenues.
                International football (played amongst nations rather than clubs) is also very consequent, as shown below by the annual revenues
                generated by the Fédération Internationale de Football Association (FIFA). Those revenues are extremely cyclical and peak
                every 4 years when the male FIFA WC is hosted. We can also see that over the 2003-2022 period, revenues generated during
                WC years skyrocketed. Most of it can be explained by peaking television broadcasting and marketing rights, 
                as the popularity of this event spread over time.
                <br>
                The data comes from FIFA's 4-year cyclical income statements. Part of it was scraped directly from the FIFA website, however most of
                it can only be found on PDF documents. I proceeded to scrape the 2003-2006 PDF income statement using Tabula on Python. The rest of 
                the PDFs (2007-2018) unfortunately requested authorisation for scraping. I had to obtain this data through Excel. All info sources 
                were eventually uniformed and merged with Pandas.

                Given the importance of the male World Cup can this
                event translate into economic benefits? A research paper by Mello
                determined that winning a WC increases GDP growth by at least 0.25% in the 2 subsequent quarters (Mello, 2022). The
                graph below aims at investigating the same relationship between a WC win and GDP growth, looking at events
                between 1982 and 2022, and observing real growth rates 2 years before and after the win. We can see a clear increase in growth rates at the year the competition was won (t0). While
                many factors constantly influence the growth of GDP and we cannot attribute this increase at t0 solely to football,
                this dynamic event study helps shed light on the economic consequences of a WC win.
                <br>
                This data was scraped through the IMF API, using the NGDP_RPCH dataset for real GDP growth rates. Each series was batch
                downloaded using a loop function, which automatically converts the data into pandas dataframes. Each df was then cleaned
                and the "relative years" were calculated for each World Cup (ex: 2008 was t-2 for Spain, 2023 was t1 for Argentina, etc.) The 
                dataframes were then combined into one.

                Let's now explore the  
                impact of a WC win on stock markets. If football events have financial repercussions, those could  be captured
                by daily variations of local stock market indexes. To verify this, we observe the daily change in Index value of the
                last 6 World Cup winners in the period around the victory. The graph below identifies no significant jump of stock market index values in the period
                directly following the World Cup final. Index values stay relatively consistent over the studied period (30 days before and 
                after the final). We can thus argue that a World Cup win has no impact on a country's stock market index.
<br>
                The data was extracted from Investing.com UK. Scraping this site required authorisation,
                thus data had to be extracted from Excel. Historical values had to be extracted individually for each country and time period. I then
                applied a Python function to attribute the mark 'T' to the specific day of the final, t-x for all days prior and t+x for all
                days following. I extracted data for +/- 150 days, but had to restrict it to 30 days to make the chart more readable.

            <p style="text-align: justify;">
                While national indexes might not be affected by a World Cup win, stock markets as a whole could be impacted in different ways.
                World Cups are sponsored by large multinationals, which benefit from the event by receiving important exposure during the
                competition. This exposure serving as an important marketing tool may impact the market capitalisation of the company. To
                estimate this, we look at stock prices of the main 4 sponsors of the 2022 World Cup over the period before, during and after
                the competition. This analysis however shows no consequent impact of the World Cup on stock prices over this period.
                <br>
                To automatise and accelerate the data collection process, I used the Yahoo Finance python module which allows
                direct extraction of stock market data. Defining the start and end dates, I extracted the data for the 4 main sponsors.
                As I was only focusing on the 2022 World Cup, there was no need to define relative dates (t-1, t0, etc.) like in
                the previous graphs, To clearly indicate the period over which the World Cup was taking place, I defined its start and end 
                dates with vertical bars using layers on Vega-lite.

    <h3>3- Social Implications</h3>

    <section>
        <div class="chart-description">
            <p style="text-align: justify;">
                Football having such a large fan base, the occurrence
                of football events may have important social repercussions. Football matches have often
                been associated with spikes in disruptions of public order. To study this relationship between football and public order, precise data is unavailable for World Cup events, so we focus here on English football. Looking at neighbourhoods located close to a
                stadium, we see that the number of police stops&searches tends to increase on days when a match is played.
                The estimated R square of 0.35 tells us a portion of the variation in stops & searches
                is explained by the occurrence of football games
                <br>
                This data was gathered using the Police UK API stop&search dataset. While data on actual crimes would've been more informative, the API doesn't provide the specific day on which
                a crime took place, making it difficult to relate crime to a football match. I fed the API the geographic coordinates of 10 Premier
                League stadiums, and looked at stops & searches within a mile of the stadium. The data
                was batch downloaded with a loop function automatically converting it into a dataframe. 
                Information on football match dates was scraped directly from the
                Premier League website.

    <h3>4- Conclusion</h3>

    <p style="text-align: justify;">
        This research provides some elements to estimate the economic and social repercussions of football events. The seasonal nature
        of the revenues perceived by the FIFA, as well as the increase in GDP growth experienced by winning nations on the year of
        the competition support Mello's findings of an economic boost generated by a win. However, those economic benefit do not
        seem to extend to the stock markets, which seems to be relatively unaffected by football competitions, even when firms
        are directly involved with them. Finally, the occurrence of football games tends to be associated with increased police 
        activity, at least in key English cities. While we cannot extrapolate these findings to other countries or competitions,
        they support the popular view that football games can be a source of disruption of the public order.
        <br><br>
        Further research could put these results into perspective by comparing them with economic and social consequences of
        other popular sport events, such as the Olympic games or the cricket or rugby World Cups. Other types of social
        consequences could also be explored, such as the impact on domestic violence or alcohol consumption.
