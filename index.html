            <h2>UK growth in numbers</h2>
            <p> At the Festival of Economics, Russell Jones made a case for the "Half a Century of British Economic Decline"

        </div>
        <figure id="UK_growth"></figure> <!-- we give it an id so we can put a vega-lite graph here with VegaEmbed -->
        <p>This point is debattable, especially when confronted with the real evolution of the UK economy over that period. British GDP
        has risen steadily in the latter part of the 20th century and early 21st century</p>

                At the Festival, a panel was held to discuss sluggish UK productivity since the Great Recession. Is that an observable phenomenon?

        <p>We can indeed observe a shift in the productivity trend after the 2008 financial crisis. Productivity grows at a lower rate 
            during the 2010s, supporting the point made by the panelists
