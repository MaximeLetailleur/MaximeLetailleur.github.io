        <p>This point is debattable, especially when confronted with the real evolution of the UK economy over that period. British GDP

                Here is a graph charting the price evolution of beef patties in 1 british stores in 2023-24. The data from Davies & McElvoy (2024)
                was used. I joined the items and prices datasets using a common key, and narrowed it down to 1 store and 1 product. Grouping the many
                observations into daily, then monthly averages, I ended up with a handful of datapoints for this product that i could chart in a clear and readable way.

                Here is the 2nd graph for the CC9 coding challenge. This one displays the maximum and minimum prices for each of the 6 stores
                where there is information on the frozen beef patties (no information from store 2), along with the price spread for each store
                (maximum - minimum). The goal here is to represent which store experienced the largest variation for that particular product. To get to
                this data, I narrowed down information on this product, and did a maximum and minimum analysis for each store. There's a tooltip too!
                NB: I don't have a tile to write the pounds symbol on my keyboard, so it's a dollar sign instead.
